# Bloom 🌱

A habit tracker app that uses gardening metaphors to help you grow positive habits and prune negative ones. Built with React Native and Expo.

Bloom is a mobile application that transforms habit tracking into a nurturing garden experience. Instead of traditional checklists, you plant seeds (habits), watch them grow, celebrate blooms (progress), and prune weeds (negative habits). The app combines personal growth tracking with social features, allowing you to share your journey with friends and find inspiration in their progress.
